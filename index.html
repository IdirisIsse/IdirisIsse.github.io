      <h3>Idiris Isse</h3>
      <p>  Hello my name is Idiris Isse and i am a first year Computer Science student. Before this academic year i had not studied computer science nor coded before. This year was very interesting for me as I feel like i've learnt a lot about the coding world and feel a lot more confident about coding in Java. What i like about coding is that feeling o frelief when you finally find the problem in your code and resolve it. I have a lot of hobbies outside of studying such as football which i enjoy playing aswell as watching.</p>
